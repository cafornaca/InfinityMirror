# InfinityMirror
By Charlie Fornaca and Gavin Plesko

## Background

In January, I visited the EMP museum in Seattle and fell in love with the “infinity mirrors” in the science fiction exhibit. I also got to experience a classmate's really cool LED shoes that change colors depending on the pressure. I decided that making an infinity mirror with some practical application would be a great basis for the project. 

## Project Plan

We used the Adafruit Neo-Pixel library to help us achieve our plans for the infinity mirror. We included three major settings for the mirror: LightCycle, AnalogClock, & PartyMode

I wanted to set the LEDs on the infinity mirror on a timer of some sort that can continuously run throughout the day when turned on. The color of the LEDs will change depending on the time of day (similar to screen-dimming programs such as F.lux): cooler temperature lights for the daytime and warmer temperatures for nighttime. 

Gavin's idea was to create an analog clock using the LEDs. When set to AnalogClock, the mirror display becomes visually similar to that of your everyday analog wall clock.

We also wanted to have some fun with the LED's and have various "party modes" that display the different effects one can achieve with strip LED's.
